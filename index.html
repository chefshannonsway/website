            I have the honor to give live vegan cooking classes at the Rancho
            Mirage Library, where I demonstrate how to create delicious,
            plant-based dishes. These classes focus on teaching participants the
            basics of vegan cooking, from selecting the right ingredients to
            mastering techniques that bring out the best flavors in plant-based
            meals. The classes are designed to be engaging and informative,
            helping attendees feel confident in their ability to prepare
            healthy, sustainable, and tasty vegan meals at home.

            Join me for an authentic tour of Japan where I seek to show you
            lesser known attractions as well as a glimpse into everyday life.
            This trip is for the active, curious traveler who is excited to try
            new experiences while in the company of our small group. For
            example, I will lead you around Tokyo using the train system rather
            than booking a charter bus. You will be amazed at what you learn
            about the people and the country by commuting with locals. The
            trains are incredibly clean, safe, and ultra punctual. The people
            are kind, helpful and respectful - all of this would be missed
            riding on a private bus.

              <p>Dear Friends,</p>
              <p>Please join me on an upcoming trip to beautiful Japan!</p>
              <p>A little about the trip:</p>
              <p>
                Overall, I am trying to strike a balance between showing you
                some famous sites, but introducing you to lesser known sites
                that are equally spectacular. Right now, Japan is suffering from
                over tourism in some well known areas, but there are also
                amazing destinations that would be grateful for our tourist
                dollars and we won’t end up standing in lines with hundreds of
                other tourists. I have built some “free days” into the last week
                of the itinerary so that you have the option to make day or
                overnight trips on your own if it is important to you to visit
                more areas outside Tokyo like Kyoto, Hiroshima or Enoshima
                Island. For those of you that want to stay with me, I will use
                those days to show you some interesting and fun things in the
                greater Tokyo area. I will be treating you to 2 fun experiences:
                a hands-on sushi making class, and a night of bowling! I will
                even treat you all to the first round of beverages at the
                bowling alley - which we will buy out of a vending machine 😯!
                There will also be the option to add a 2 hour kayak tour through
                Tokyo for $50 paid to the kayak company. No experience is needed
                and all equipment is supplied. They even have complete rain
                outfits if necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                I can’t wait to introduce you to the amazing, diverse city of
                Tokyo. Tokyo is huge! There are some well known spots, and many
                you may not have heard of. I look forward to showing you my
                favorites! We will also venture outside of Tokyo via bullet
                train! Our first stop will be the charming, 1300 year old
                village of Shibu Onsen. Shibu Onsen is famous for its 9
                different hot mineral springs. It is said that if you bathe in
                all of them, you will leave with good fortune:) Our lodging in
                Shibu will be in authentic, Japanese style rooms. Bring an open
                mind and enjoy the experience. When we check into our Inn, we
                will be given Japanese robes to wear as we explore the village
                and try all 9 of the hot springs. I can’t wait to get a group
                photo of all of us in our robes under the town landmark arch!
                Shibu Onsen is located very near the area where we will take a
                light hike and visit the Japanese Macaques (Snow Monkeys).
              </p>
              <p>
                We will get 2 nights at a temple in beautiful Nagano (sight of
                past winter olympics). Gorgeous Zenkoji Temple is our
                destination for 2 nights. The monks will welcome us and cook us
                breakfast and dinner each day. Joining them for sunrise
                meditation is optional. We will also travel via train to another
                city and see a National Heritage landmark; Matsumoto Castle. We
                will have a professional tour guide to help us see the area.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the expenses are covered in the tour price, but a few
                are not such as airfare. Please book a flight to Tokyo Haneda
                (HND) airport as a first choice, Tokyo Narita (NRT) is a 2nd
                choice. Haneda is closer. I haven’t booked my flight yet, but my
                strategy is to try to arrive at Haneda in the afternoon. It
                seems to work best for me in combatting jet lag. If you are
                looking for assistance, the tour company will help you. If you
                are looking for a bargain, Japan Airlines has launched a new, no
                frills airline called ZipAir. I have heard that flights are as
                low as $350 each way from LAX.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will need money for commuting via trains (except the bullet
                trains which are covered in the tour package). I will teach you
                how to load train fare on your phones and how to pay for your
                train rides. Commuting is very inexpensive. Some of the rides
                will be about $.60, with an average of about $1.30 per ride.
                Your phone is your ticket and your phone will work without you
                getting roaming charges, and you don’t need wifi. I will be with
                you for all of our outings and will show you how to navigate the
                amazing, public transit system. Many tours will have you riding
                charter buses to move around, but I chose to use public transit
                for this tour. One of the most beautiful things about Japan are
                the people. Some of the most impactful experiences I have had
                involved trying to find my way using the trains. On this tour
                you will see firsthand that even with a complete language
                barrier, people will go out of their way to make sure that you
                get on the correct train. I will lead you through the famous
                Shinjuku Station, the world's busiest train station at 3.6
                million people per day! You will be amazed at how spotlessly
                clean it is and how punctual the trains are.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the meals that are not covered in the tour package, I hope
                you will join me at some of my favorite spots where you can
                order off the menu. Because of the current exchange rate, I
                think you will be amazed at how little you will spend on food. I
                have a favorite place to grab a small salad and a green smoothie
                that costs the equivalent of about $1.75! Really! There are 2
                “nicer” places that I want to take you and those are only about
                $10 for a meal!
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the tour is fully booked, I will reach out to you to
                schedule some meetings so that we can get to know one another
                and talk about our plans. I am sure you have many questions!
              </p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

          <p>
            Arrive in Tokyo with lodging in a less touristy neighborhood
            boutique hotel. Explore Tokyo via foot and the famous train system.

            (black sesame is a must try!) <br />
            - Shopping excursion on famous Kappabashi Street where you can buy
            anything a home chef desires (knives, ceramics, kitchen gadgets)
            <br />
            - Dine with me at some of my favorite eateries which includes eating
            ramen at a train station 🍲 - A day at Chef Kurinas countryside home
            kitchen in Saitama where she will teach us how to make tofu, then we
            will all work together to create and enjoy a vegan feast <br />
            - Bullet train excursion to the mountains to see the famous Japanese
            Macaques (Snow Monkeys) with 2 nights in a 1300 year old village
            that is famous for its Onsens (natural hot springs) <br />
            - 1 night at a Buddist Monastery that includes 2 vegan meals
            <br />
            - Bullet train trip to a 15th century castle

              I hope to show you that eating the plant-based way is not about
              sacrifice, but instead, is an introduction to delicious flavors
              and ingredients with limitless combinations
